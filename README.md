## Introduction
Inspired by previous work in classification [11], DTT involves three models to make full use of unlabeled images appropriately.Concretely, three models are optimized circularly. One model is updated in each training step, where the pseudo labels in the unlabeled set are generated by the other two models through a voting-based integration. In our manner, joint training of the three models effectively reduces the risk of model degradation. The voting mechanism not only ensures the reliability of training data but also leads to robust segmentation results.

## Start Up

### Download the data (PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes)
- [PASCAL VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/)
- [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)

### Training on PASCAL VOC:
   ```shell
   $ cd ./voc8.res50v3+.DTT
   $ bash script.sh
   ```
 ![method](https://github.com/anshan-ar/DTT/blob/main/method.png)
- Base model obtained by CPS/CPS+CutMix training.
- The third network branch is obtained by DTT training on the basis of the model obtained above.
- Final results are obtained through the DTT voting mechanism.
